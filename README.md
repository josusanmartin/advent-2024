## Overview

Welcome to the **advent-2024** project! This repository contains solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024), an annual programming challenge created by Eric Wastl. The challenge consists of small daily programming puzzles released every December, designed to improve problem-solving skills and programming expertise.

Each day's challenge is implemented in Clojure, and the repository is organized to help you understand the solutions and run them easily.

## Structure

The project is organized by day, with each day's code located in the `src/advent_2024` directory:

```
advent-2024/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md            # Project documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ deps.edn             # Dependency configuration
â””â”€â”€ src/
    â””â”€â”€ advent_2024/
        â”œâ”€â”€ 01/
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ core.clj
        â”œâ”€â”€ 02/
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ core.clj
        â”œâ”€â”€ 03/
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ core.clj
        â””â”€â”€ ...          # Additional days
```

Each day's solution is self-contained in its respective `core.clj` file and processes the day's input (e.g., `01.txt`, `02.txt`, `03.txt`) from the corresponding directory.

## Running the Solutions

### Prerequisites
1. Install [Clojure CLI tools](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started).
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/advent-2024.git
   cd advent-2024
   ```

### Running Individual Days
Navigate to the desired day's folder and run its corresponding solution:

#### Example: Running Day 2
```bash
clj -M -m advent-2024.02.core
```

#### Example: Running Day 3
```bash
clj -M -m advent-2024.03.core
```

## Notes

- **Input Files**: Each day processes its input file (`01.txt`, `02.txt`, etc.), located in the corresponding subdirectory.
- **Output**: Solutions may generate intermediate or cleaned files (e.g., `cleaned_part1.txt`, `cleaned_part2.txt` for Day 3).
- **Dependencies**: Defined in `deps.edn`.
